# Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow and Keras

This project implements neural style transfer based on the algorithm proposed by VGG 19 using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

Neural style transfer is a technique that allows you to apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another image, creating visually appealing and unique results. This implementation uses a VGG19 model pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction and optimization using gradient descent.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
